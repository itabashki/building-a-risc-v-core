# Building a RISC-V CPU Core

This is my working repository for the Linux Foundation edX course on [Building a RISC-V CPU Core](https://www.edx.org/course/building-a-risc-v-cpu-core) (LFD111x) by [Steve Hoover](https://www.linkedin.com/in/steve-hoover-a44b607/). It includes all the work I did for Chapter 4 and 5 of the online course, with the intermediate progress visible through the commit history for this repository.

I have since completed the course with a 100% grade. [Link to the verified certificate.](https://courses.edx.org/certificates/b5185963b2a7433d96f9c2a86f4e989b)
